## Introduction

I'm thrilled to embark on a month-long adventure of JavaScript programming. This challenge is designed to help me enhance my coding skills, improve my problem-solving abilities, and boost my creativity. Each day, for 30 days, I'll build a unique JavaScript project. Whether I'm a beginner looking to get started or an experienced developer wanting to brush up on my skills, this challenge is for me! 🎉

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
- A web browser for testing your projects.
- Git installed on your system (for version control, optional but recommended). 🛠️

### Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/anirudhahavaldar/30-Days-30-JavaScript-Projects.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd 30-days-30-javascript-projects
```
3. Create a new branch for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/day-1-project
```
4. Start building your first project (Day 1) by following the project structure guidelines below. 🚧

## Project Ideas

Here's a list of project ideas for each day of the challenge:

1. **Day 1**: To-Do List.




Feel free to modify the ideas or come up with your own projects. The goal is to challenge yourself and have fun while coding! 🤓

## Project Structure

Each project folder should follow a consistent structure:
```
day-1-project/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```


- `index.html`: HTML file for the project's structure.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the project.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for the project's functionality.

Ensure that your projects are responsive and accessible. Comment your code, use meaningful variable names, and strive for clean and well-organized code. 🧹

## Resources

For each project, make use of online resources, tutorials, and documentation. Here are some recommended resources:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)
